# Review by: Aaron Robinson

### Overall Feedback: The code looks oragnized and streamlined well, I was unfamiliar with the querySelectorAll I'll be sure to use that in the future. I also like the idea of displaying alerts when inputs are invalid that is a nice touch. After adding your name to the document somehow, I have no complaints, great job
